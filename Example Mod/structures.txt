The Mod structure in mods folder should always be 
..mods\Your_Mod/media/Your_stuff

for workshop it is
..Workshop\Your_Mod_Collection/Contents/mods/Your_Mods_Can_Have_Multiple/media/Your_stuff

Usually if your mod is not loading/appearing in game, you messed something with that or mod.info file.

That's why when you install for example 10 years later MOD, you have 6 version of it, because it is collection of mods.
